# .tmux.conf

My tmux configuration file

## Setup
- Clone this repository (I like to clone such configurations in ~/.configs/)
- Run `chomd +x config.sh`
- Run `. ./config`

NOTE: Ensure you run `config.sh` preceded by a `.` so that the configurations are set in the same shell and not a forked
child.
